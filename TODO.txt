 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

 - Add walls to corridors?

 - Smooth player movement?

 - Add offset and mesh to tile
 
 - Implement visible and seen to tile class

 - Make FOV a circle (how to make circle in 2d grid?)

 - Culling for 3d meshes

 - Bigger max vertex index?

  v0.3.0 TASKS:
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
 - Goals:
   X Pick a setting/theme
   X Wraparound square tile maps on a sphere
   + Make a more sophisticated "overworld" map generator with heightmap, water, biomes, caves

 - Planet gen, Debug tools:
   + Longer render distance (big planets are clipping)
   + Redo camera controls (camera rotates/moves/zooms around a fixed point (no rotation on planet itself))
   + Add planet gen button and planet info in debug window

 - Planet gen, LOD/chunks:
   + Divide planet mesh into 6 seperate meshes (one for each cube face)
   + Divide each cube face mesh into 9 seperate meshes (chunks)
   + Check distance to chunk and render at LOD level 1/2/3 depending on distance

 - Recalculate normals for verts during planet mesh generation or remove normal value from verts?
 
 - Planet gen, Terrain.
   + Make continents
   + Make tectonic plates and assign contents to plates
   + Mountain generation
   + Landscape type: Dunes
   + Add rivers
   + Mountains: Add erosion
   + Add water (oceans/lakes/etc.)
   + Make temperature map
   + Make humidity/rainfall map
   + Make wind map
   + Assign biomes (KÃ¶ppen-Geiger classification)
   + Add texture: sand/snow/ice/grass/rock/lava/etc.
   + Add vegetation/rocks/trees/etc.
   + Add caves
   + Assign planet type: Earth-like/Ocean/Sand/Rock/Lava/Ice/Gas
   + Add planet extras: Moons & rings
